### Lead Scoring Case Study
This case study involves helping X Education, an education company, improve its lead conversion rate by building a logistic regression model to assign lead scores. The aim is to identify potential leads with the highest chances of converting to paying customers and handling future problems to achieve a target conversion rate of 80%.Used a dataset of over 9000 leads with more than 20 different features to train and test the model, achieving an accuracy rate of over 90%. Employed various techniques such as data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance

### Heart Disease Prediction
Developed a machine learning model using Python and scikit-learn to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on their medical history and lifestyle factors. Used a dataset of over 1000 patients with 14 different features to train and test the model, achieving an accuracy rate of over 85%. Employed various techniques such as data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance. This project demonstrates my proficiency in data science, machine learning, and Python programming, as well as my ability to analyze complex datasets and develop predictive models to help diagnose and prevent heart disease.

### Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
I made this bike sharing project for BoomBikes to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after the ending quarantine situation  across the nation due to Covid-19. To evaluate the performance of the model, I used various evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score. I also performed feature selection to identify the most significant features that influence the bike sharing service. Finally, I used the model to predict the Demands of the houses in the testing set and achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set. This project demonstrates my proficiency in linear regression modeling, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation. 
Tools Used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
